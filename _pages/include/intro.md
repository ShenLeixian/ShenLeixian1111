Hello! I am Leixian Shen (沈磊贤), a master student from Tsinghua University advised by Prof. [<font color=Black>Jianmin Wang</font>](https://www.thss.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/faculty/jianminwang.htm). Now I am also taking an intern at Microsoft Research Asia under the supervision of Dr. [<font color=Black>Yun Wang</font>](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/wangyun/).

My research interest is to leverage the intersection of Information Visualization (VIS), Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Data Science (DS), and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to democratize visual data analysis and storytelling, especially on intelligent visualization creation and text-visual interplay. Please feel free to contact me if you are interested in my research.
