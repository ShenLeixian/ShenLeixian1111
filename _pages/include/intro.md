Hello! I am Leixian Shen (沈磊贤), a Ph.D candidate in Department of Computer Science and Engineering at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, under the supervision of Prof. [<font color=Black>Huamin Qu</font>](http://www.huamin.org/), affiliated with [<font color=Black>VisLab</font>](http://vis.cse.ust.hk/). Prior to that, I received my master's degree with honor in School of Software at Tsinghua University, under the supervision of Prof. [<font color=Black>Jianmin Wang</font>](https://www.thss.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/faculty/jianminwang.htm). I have also taken a research internship at Microsoft Research Asia advised by Dr. [<font color=Black>Yun Wang</font>](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/wangyun/).

My research interest is to democratize visual data analysis and communication through the intersection of Data Science (DS), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Visualization (VIS), and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). I aim to empower everyone to be the analyst and story director of their data.

<!-- especially on Human-AI Collaboration, AI for Visualization, Text-Visual Interplay, and Intelligent Data Visualization Creation. -->

If you are interested in my research, please feel free to contact me via *<u>lshenaj@connect.ust.hk</u>*.
